# World Cup Sweepstake Generator
Sweepstake Generator for the 2018 Fifa World Cup (late I know).

Project created in order to learn and famalirise myself with Angular JS 1.X.

## To-Do

- Add country flags to data and display on results page
- Vertically optimise (e.g. when adding many players, inputs flow off screen)
- Optimise desktop layout
- Allow for more than one country to be assigned to each individual

### Possible Extensions

- Generalise the sweepstake so not specific to the World Cup
